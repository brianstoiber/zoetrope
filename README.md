# zoetrope
Arduino-based zoetrope

The inspiration for this project came when my family and I visited The Exploratorium in San Francisco in 2022. My son was/is obsessed with Mr. Freeze (Batman) and we found a Batman themed zoetrope designed and built by Gary and Danny Aden. My son stood in front of this for 2 hours. The following year we went back and again, he stood in front of it for at least 2 hours, if not more. I wanted to see if I could replicate this on my own so that he could watch it at home.
